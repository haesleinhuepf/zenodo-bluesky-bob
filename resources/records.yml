    The format is tailored for the OMERO.web script&nbsp;"KeyVal_from_csv.py"&nbsp;
    (from the version &lt;=5.8.3 of the core omero-scripts).

    Attached is also a video of Thomas Zobel, the head of the imaging core facility

    older version of the workbook and OMERO, but the core functionality remains unchanged.

    Please keep in mind, that the OMERO.web script(s) to handle Key-Value Pairs from/to

  description: 'Bioimaging refers to a collection of methods to visualize the internal
    structures and mechanisms of living organisms. The fundamental tool, the microscope,
    has enabled seminal discoveries like that of the cell as the smallest unit of
    life, and continues to expand our understanding of biological processes. Today,
    we can follow the interaction of single molecules within nanoseconds in a living
    cell, and the development of complete small organisms like fish and flies over
    several days starting from the fertilized egg. Each image pixel encodes multiple
    spatiotemporal and spectral dimensions, compounding the massive volume and complexity
    of bioimage data. Proper handling of this data is indispensable for analysis and
    its lack has become a growing hindrance for the many disciplines of the life and
    biomedical sciences relying on bioimaging. No single domain has the expertise
    to tackle this bottleneck alone.

    As a method-specific consortium, NFDI4BIOMAGE seeks to address these issues, enabling
    bioimaging data to be shared and re-used like they are acquired, i.e., independently
    of disciplinary boundaries. We will provide solutions for exploiting the full
    information content of bioimage data and enable new discoveries through sharing
    and re-analysis. Our RDM strategy is based on a robust needs analysis that derives
    not only from a community survey but also from over a decade of experience in
    German BioImaging, the German Society for Microscopy and Image Analysis. It considers
    the entire lifecycle of bioimaging data, from acquisition to archiving, including
    analysis and enabling re-use. A foundational element of this strategy is the definition
    of a common, cloud-compatible, and interoperable digital object that bundles binary
    images with their descriptive and provenance metadata. With members from plant
    biology to neuroscience, NFDI4BIOIMAGE will champion the standardization of bioimage
    data to create a framework that answers discipline-specific needs while ensuring
    communication and interoperability with data types and RDM systems across domains.
    Integration of bioimage data with, e.g., omics data as the basis for spatial omics,
    holds great promise for fields such as cancer medicine. Unlocking the full potential
    of bioimage data will rely on the development and broad availability of exceptional
    analysis tools and training sets. NFDI4BIOIMAGE will make these accessible and
    usable including cutting-edge AI-based methods in scalable cloud environments.
    NFDI4BIOIMAGE intersects with multiple NFDI consortia, most prominently with GHGA
    for linking image and genomics data and with DataPLANT on the definition of FAIR
    data objects. Last but not least, NFDI4BIOIMAGE is internationally well connected
    and represents the opportunity for German scientists to keep path with and have
    a voice in several international initiatives focusing on the FAIRification of
    bioimage data as one of the main challenges for the advancement of knowledge in
    the life and biomedical sciences.'

  description: 'The rise of Open Science (OS) and the academic community&rsquo;s needs
    that come with it bring about a range of challenges for academic libraries. To
    face these challenges, the University of Konstanz has created a competence unit
    called&nbsp;Team Open Science&nbsp;in the Communication, Information, Media Center
    (KIM) - a joint unit of library and IT infrastructure. The Team creates synergies
    within itself and across the library. In December 2023, it involved 12 staff members
    specialising in open access (OA), research data management (RDM), open educational
    resources (OER) and virtual research environments (VRE). It collaborates closely
    with other KIM departments. This submission shall serve as a best practice example
    for the impact of OS on research libraries and, beyond that, the impact of research
    libraries on universities.

    To enhance and foster OS, the Team provides individual consultations, services
    and office hours for researchers. Here, it collaborates closely with other librarians
    like subject specialists and the Team University Publications. Along similar lines,
    the KIM offers institutional repositories for publications (KOPS) and research
    data (KonDATA). Beyond that, the Team provides solutions to host OA journals and
    analyses researchers&rsquo; VRE needs to decide on implementation options. In
    sum, the Team is the central OS contact point for the entire university, underlining
    the major role the library holds in making institutional impact.

    Furthermore, the Team had the leading role in creating the University of Konstanz&rsquo;
    OS Policy, one of the first ones passed by a German university. This policy stands
    out because it encompasses various OS domains. It demands, among other things,
    that text publications be made OA and that research data be managed according
    to relevant subject-specific standards. If permissible and reasonable, it demands
    that research data should be made publicly available at the earliest possible
    time. Along these lines, the policy has a large impact on how the library handles
    closed access books and subscription-based journals. As a consequence, OA is pursued
    wherever possible, leading to the highest OA quota of all German universities.
    In that sense, the Team is a crucial driving force of OS in the University of
    Konstanz, which ties in with the library&rsquo;s major role of open research transformation.

    Beyond the University of Konstanz, the Team is involved in a range of national
    and international projects collaborating with other libraries. On a national level,
    they lead the project open.access-network which provides an information platform
    for researchers and librarians and connects the German-speaking OA community through
    events like bar camps. The project KOALA-AV supports libraries in establishing
    consortial solutions for financing Diamond OA publications. Moreover, the Team
    is involved in the federal state initiative for RDM in Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg
    (bwFDM). Here, the Team is in charge of forschungsdaten.info, the German-speaking
    countries&rsquo; leading RDM information platform, which will be offered in English
    within the next years. Internationally, the Team cooperates with librarians and
    other OS professionals from the European Reform University Alliance (ERUA) and
    the European University for Well-Being (EUniWell), establishing formats for best
    practice exchange, such as monthly OS Meet-Ups.'

  description: 'The workshop introduced key topics of research data management (RDM)
    and the implementation thereof on a life science campus. Internal and external
    experts of RDM including scientists that apply chosen software tools presented
    the basic concepts and their implementation to a broad audience.&nbsp;

    Talks covered general aspects of data handling and sorting, naming conventions,
    data storage repositories and archives, licensing of material, data and code management
    using git, data protection particularly regarding patient data and in genome sequencing
    and more. Two data management concepts and exemplary tools were highlighted in
    particular, being electronic lab notebooks with eLabFTW and the bio-image management
    software OMERO. Those were chosen because of three aspects: the large benefit
    of these management tools for a life science campus, their free availability as
    open source tools with the option of contribution of required functionalities
    and first existing use cases on campus already supported by CMCB/PoL IT.

    Two talks by Robert Haase (ScaDS.AI/ Uni Leipzig) and Robert M&uuml;ller (Kontaktstelle
    Forschungsdaten, TU Dresden with contributions from Denise D&ouml;rfel) that opened

  description: 'Here we share the material used in a workshop held on May 13th, 2024,
    at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg (on-premise)

    Description:Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional
    data, allowing us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal
    resolution. Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve
    quantitative information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of
    bioimaging files that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging
    to organize, structure, and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data
    often needs to be moved between collaboration partners, transformed into open
    formats, processed with a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized
    images for presentation. The path from image acquisition to final publication
    figures with quantitative results must be documented and reproducible.

    In this workshop, participants learn how to use OMERO to organize their data and
    enrich the bioimage data with structured metadata annotations.We also focus on
    image analysis workflows in combination with OMERO based on the Fiji/ImageJ software
    and using Jupyter Notebooks. In the last part, we explore how OMERO can be used
    to create publication figures and prepare bioimage data for publication in a suitable
    repository such as the Bioimage Archive.

    Module 1&nbsp;(9 am - 10.15 am):&nbsp;Basics of OMERO, data structuring and annotation

    Module 2&nbsp;(10.45 am - 12.45 pm):&nbsp;OMERO and Fiji

    Module 3&nbsp;(1.45 pm - 3.45 pm):&nbsp;OMERO and Jupyter Notebooks

    Module 4&nbsp;(4.15 pm - 6. pm):&nbsp;Publication-ready figures and data with
    OMERO

    The target group for this workshopThis workshop is directed at researchers at
    all career levels who plan to or have started to use OMERO for their microscopy
    research data management.&nbsp;We encourage the workshop participants to bring
    example data from their research to discuss suitable metadata annotation for their
    everyday practice.

    Prerequisites:Users should bring their laptops and have access to the internet
    through one of the following options:- eduroam- institutional WiFi- VPN connection
    to their institutional networks to access OMERO

    Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing
    us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution.
    Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative
    information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files
    that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure,
    and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved
    between collaboration partners, transformed into open formats, processed with
    a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation.
    The path from image acquisition to final publication figures with quantitative
    results must be documented and reproducible.

    In this workshop, participants learn how to use structured metadata annotations
    in the image data management platform OMERO (OME Remote Objects) to optimize their
    data handling. This strategy helps both with organizing data for easier processing
    and analysis and for the preparation of data publication in journal manuscripts
    and in public repositories such as the BioImage Archive. Participants learn the
    principles of leveraging object-oriented data organization in OMERO to enhance
    findability and usability of their data, also in collaborative settings. The integration
    of OMERO with image analysis tools, in particular ImageJ/Fiji, will be trained.
    Moreover, users learn about community-accepted metadata checklists (REMBI) to
    enrich the value of their data toward reproducibility and reusability. In this
    workshop, we will provide hands-on training and recommendations on:


    Structured metadata annotation features in OMERO and how to use them

    Types of metadata in bioimaging: Technical metadata, sample metadata, analysis
    metadata

    The use of ontologies and terminologies for metadata annotation

    REMBI, the recommended metadata for biological images

    Metadata-assisted image analysis streamlining

    Tools for metadata annotation in OMERO


    The target group for this workshop

    This workshop is directed at researchers at all career levels who have started
    using OMERO for their microscopy research data management. We encourage the workshop
    participants to bring example data from their research to discuss suitable metadata
    annotation for their everyday practice.

  description: 'This are a two Key-Value pair templates used for the annotation of
    datasets in OMERO. They are tailored for light- and electron microcopy data for
    all research projects of the research group of Prof. T. Mueller-Reichert.&nbsp;
    All members of the Core Facility Cellular Imaging agreed for using these templates
    to annotate data in OMERO. Furthermore, there are a corresponding public example
    datasets used in the publication "Setting up an institutional OMERO environment
    for bioimage data: perspectives from both facility staff and users" and are available
    here:

    https://omero.med.tu-dresden.de/webclient/?show=dataset-1552 --&gt; for lattice-light
    sheet microscopy

    https://omero.med.tu-dresden.de/webclient/?show=dataset-1555--&gt; for electron
    microscopy data

    That templates are based on the REMBI recommendations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8606015)
    and were developed during the PoL-Bio-Image Analysis Symposium in Dresden Aug
    28th- Sept 1st in 2023 and further adapeted during the usage of OMERO.&nbsp;

    With every template it is possible to create a csv-file, that can be used to annotate
    a dataset in OMERO using the annotation script (https://github.com/ome/omero-scripts/blob/develop/omero/annotation_scripts/).

    How to use:


    fill the template with metadata

    select and copy the data range containing the Keys and Values

    open a new excel sheet and paste transpose in cell A1

    Important: cell A1 contains always the name ''dataset'' and cell A2 contains the
    exact name of the dataset, which should be annotated in OMERO

    save the new excel sheet in csv-file (comma separated values) format


    Examples can be seen in sheet 3 ''csv_TOMO'' and sheet 5 csv_TEM''.

    Important note: The code has to be 8-Bit UCS transformation format (UTF-8) otherwise
    several characters (for example &micro;, %,&deg;) might be not able to decode
    by the annotation script. We encountered this issue with old Microsoft-Office
    versions (MS Office 2016).&nbsp;

    Note: By filling the values in the excel sheet, avoid the usage of comma as decimal
    delimiter.

  description: 'In bio-medical research we often need to combine a broad range of
    expertise to run complex experiments and analyse and interpret their results.
    Also, it is desirable that all stakeholders of a project understand all parts
    of the experiment and analysis to draw and support the right conclusions. For
    imaging experiments this usually requires a basic understanding of the underlying
    physics. This has not necessarily been part of the professional training of all
    stakeholders, e.g. biologists or data scientists. Therefore an affordable platform
    for easily demonstrating and explaining imaging principles would be desirable.

    Building up on a commercially available STEM Optics kit we developed extensions
    with widely available and affordable components to demonstrate advanced imaging
    techniques like e.g. confocal, lightsheet, OPT, spectral imaging. All models are
    quick and easy to build, yet demonstrate the important physical principles each
    imaging technique is based on.

    Further use cases for this kit are training courses, demonstrations for imaging
    newbies when designing an experiment and outreach activities but also basic level
    prototyping.'

  description: Research data management (RDM) in microscopy and image analysis is
    a challenging task. Large files in proprietary formats, complex N-dimensional
    array structures, and various metadata models and formats can make image data
    handling inconvenient and difficult. For data organization, annotation, and sharing,
    researchers need solutions that fit everyday practice and comply with the FAIR
    (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. International community-based
    efforts have begun creating open data models (OME), an open file format and translation
    library (OME-TIFF, Bio-Formats), data management software platforms, and microscopy
    metadata recommendations and annotation tools. Bringing these developments into
    practice requires support and training. Iterative feedback and tool&nbsp;improvement
    is needed to foster practical adoption by the scientific&nbsp;community. The Information
    Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project&nbsp;works on guidelines, training
    resources, and practical assistance for FAIR&nbsp;microscopy RDM adoption with
    a focus on the management platform OMERO&nbsp;and metadata annotations.

  description: '"Be SURE - Be SUstainable REcommendations"The main goals and challenges
    for the Life Science (LS) communities in the Open Science framework are to increase
    reuse and sustainability of data resources, software tools, and workflows, especially
    in large-scale data-driven research and computational analyses. Here, we present
    key findings, procedures, effective measures and recommendations for generating
    and establishing sustainable LS resources based on the collaborative, cross-disciplinary
    work done within the EOSC-Life (European Open Science Cloud for Life Sciences)
    consortium. Bringing together 13 European LS Research Infrastructures (RIs), it
    has laid the foundation for an open, digital space to support biological and medical
    research. Using lessons learned from 27 selected projects, we describe the organisational,
    technical, financial and legal/ethical challenges that represent the main barriers
    to sustainability in the life sciences. We show how EOSC-Life provides a model
    for sustainable FAIR data management, including solutions for sensitive- and industry-related
    resources, by means of cross-disciplinary training and best practices sharing.
    Finally, we illustrate how data harmonisation and collaborative work facilitate
    interoperability of tools, data, solutions and lead to a better understanding
    of concepts, semantics and functionalities in the life sciences.IN PRESS EMBO

  description: Bioimaging has now entered the era of big data with faster than ever
    development of complex microscopy technologies leading to increasingly complex
    datasets. This enormous increase in data size and informational complexity within
    those datasets has brought with it several difficulties in terms of common and
    harmonized data handling, analysis and management practices, which are currently
    hampering the full potential of image data being realized. Here we outline a wide
    range of efforts and solutions currently being developed by the microscopy community
    to address these challenges on the path towards FAIR bioimage data. We also highlight
    how different actors in the microscopy ecosystem are working together, creating
    synergies that develop new approaches, and how research infrastructures, such
    as Euro-BioImaging, are fostering these interactions to shape the field.&nbsp;

  description: In the field of radiooncological research, individualised therapy is
    one of the hot topics at the moment. As a key aspect biologically-adapted therapy
    is discussed. Therapy adaption based on biological parameters&nbsp;may include
    tomographic imaging to determine biological properties of the tumour. One often
    invoked&nbsp;imaging modality is positron emission tomography (PET) using the
    tracer [18F]-fluoromisonidazole&nbsp;(FMISO) for hypoxia imaging. Hypoxia imaging
    is of interest, because hypoxic tumours are known to be radiorestistant. Even
    further, patients with hypoxic tumours have worse prognosis compared to patients&nbsp;with
    normoxic tumours. Thus, hypoxia imaging appears promising for radiotherapy treatment
    adaption.&nbsp;For example, volumetric analysis of FMISO PET could deliver additional
    hypoxia target volumes, which&nbsp;may be irradiated with higher radiation doses
    to improve the therapeutic effect. However, limited contrast&nbsp;between target
    volume and background in FMISO PET images interferes image analysis.Established&nbsp;methods
    for target volume delineation in PET do not allow determination of reliable contours
    in FMISO PET. To tackle this aspect, this thesis focusses on an earlier developed
    swarm intelligence based&nbsp;segmentation algorithm for FMISO PET and rather,
    its optimisation and validation in a clinically relevant&nbsp;setting. In this
    setting, clinical FMISO PET images were used which were acquired as part of a
    clinical&nbsp;trial performed at the Clinic and Policlinic for Radiation Therapy
    and Radiooncology of the University&nbsp;Hospital Carl Gustav Carus Dresden. The
    segmentation algorithm was applied to these imaging data&nbsp;sets and optimised
    using a cross-validation approach incorporating reference contours from experienced&nbsp;observers
    who outlined FMISO PET positive volumes manually. Afterwards, the performance
    of the algorithm&nbsp;and the properties of the resulting contours were studied
    in more detail. The algorithm was shown&nbsp;to deliver contours which were similar
    to manually-created contours to a degree like manually-created&nbsp;contours were
    similar to each other. Thus, the application of the algorithm in clinical research
    is recommended&nbsp;to eliminate inter-observer-variabilities. Finally, it was
    shown that repeated FMISO PET imaging&nbsp;before and shortly after the beginning
    of combined radiochemotherapy lead to manually-created contours&nbsp;with significantly
    higher variations than the variations of automatically-created contours using
    the&nbsp;proposed algorithm. Increased contour similarity in subsequently acquired
    imaging data highlights the&nbsp;observer-independence of the algorithm. While
    several observers outline different volumes, in identical&nbsp;data sets as well
    as in subsequent imaging data sets, the algorithm outlines more stable volumes
    in both&nbsp;cases. Thus, increased contour reproducibility is reached by automation
    of the delineation process by&nbsp;the proposed algorithm.&nbsp;

    Manual annotations: Labels/masks obtained via manual segmentation.&nbsp;For each
    region, all cells were annotated manually. Uncertain objects (Dust, fused cells)
    were left unannotated, so that the cellpose model (10.5281/zenodo.6023317) may
    mimic the same user bias during prediction. This was particularly necessary due
    to the accumulation of floating debris in the center of the well.

  description: 'This thesis deals with concepts and solutions in the field of data
    management in everyday scientific life for image data from microscopy. The focus
    of the formulated requirements has so far been on published data, which represent
    only a small subset of the data generated in the scientific process. More and
    more, everyday research data are moving into the focus of the principles for the
    management of research data that were formulated early on (FAIR-principles). The
    adequate management of this mostly multimodal data is a real challenge in terms
    of its heterogeneity and scope. There is a lack of standardised and established
    workflows and also the software solutions available so far do not adequately reflect
    the special requirements of this area. However, the success of any data management
    process depends heavily on the degree of integration into the daily work routine.
    Data management must, as far as possible, fit seamlessly into this process. Microscopy
    data in the scientific process is embedded in pre-processing, which consists of
    preparatory laboratory work and the analytical evaluation of the microscopy data.
    In terms of volume, the image data often form the largest part of data generated
    within this entire research process. In this paper, we focus on concepts and techniques
    related to the handling and description of this image data and address the necessary
    basics. The aim is to improve the embedding of the existing data management solution
    for image data (OMERO) into the everyday scientific work. For this purpose, two
    independent software extensions for OMERO were implemented within the framework
    of this thesis: OpenLink and MDEmic. OpenLink simplifies the access to the data
    stored in the integrated repository in order to feed them into established workflows
    for further evaluations and enables not only the internal but also the external
    exchange of data without weakening the advantages of the data repository. The
    focus of the second implemented software solution, MDEmic, is on the capturing
    of relevant metadata for microscopy. Through the extended metadata collection,
    a corresponding linking of the multimodal data by means of a unique description
    and the corresponding semantic background is aimed at. The configurability of
    MDEmic is designed to address the currently very dynamic development of underlying
    concepts and formats. The main goal of MDEmic is to minimise the workload and
    to automate processes. This provides the scientist with a tool to handle this
    complex and extensive task of metadata acquisition for microscopic data in a simple
    way. With the help of the software, semantic and syntactic standardisation can
    take place without the scientist having to deal with the technical concepts. The
    generated metadata descriptions are automatically integrated into the image repository
    and, at the same time, can be transferred by the scientists into formats that
    are needed when publishing the data.'
